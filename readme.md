Code Challenge 8: 

My 1st Node
My 1st Command Line

build command line application

Turns out  with javascript, you can create your own command-line and backend. Let's try this:

1. Write a node app that list your professional credentials (make it as much fun as you can, think of it as a resume)

1. Push your work to Github
1. Register for an account on npm.js
1. Publish your node app to npm

https://www.npmjs.com/



$ mkdir demo-1-node
$ cd demo-1-node

create index.js

$ node index.js
Hello!

$ npm -v
6.14.11

$ npm init

this creates package.json file

$ yarn add tailwindcss

this creates yarn.lock file

$ node .\index.mjs
name:  ASIC IPs where:  Semiconductor

$ yarn add express

node_modules/ folder
